            Our website allows for students to
            use our calculators for problems that these students might have.
            Our website looks to tackle a social justice issue. That is the lack of education amongst students as to how
            they can plan ahead in life. Many times while in school, it seems like students are there for the ride, not
            there with a plan. That is because many students don't have a goal in mind (where that be a goal of a
            certain grade or a goal of a certain career).
        </p> <br>

        <p>
            With our website's Grade Calculator, though, a student can input specific grades that he or she may have in
            specific classes. When the student finishes doing this, they can click the "Show Results" button to find out
            their final average!. This is important because it allows for the student to plan ahead and work towards
            achieving a goal (in this case, it is a GPA goal).
        </p><br>

        <p>
            Furthermore, our team realizes that a lot of students (especially in high school) are either getting their
            first jobs or gaining a source of income from doing chores around the house and such. Because of this fact,
            we created a budget calculator! This calculator will take in how much money the student has currently. After
            taking in this data, the budget calculator will give the user a specific amount of money they should use for
            different causes. The calculator also encourages wise spending (by encouraging the user to save most of
            their money and spend a small portion on entertainment).
        </p><br>

        <p>
            While we only have two calculators on our website right now, we are currently working on creating more
            calculators and improving the calculators we already have. Current plans are to allow for the user to input
            a specific goal for a grade in one class and the calculator would take the current grades and give them a
            grade they would need to get that grade goal. As for the budget calculator, current plans are to add more
            diversity in how the money is saved, spent, and how this money could be used to plan for the future.
